###
All classes derived from this class pick arguments listed in 'compute_args'. The list passed includes:
- dlznik_ids: List of debtor IDs for which the feature should be computed.
- pohladavky_dlznikov: DataFrame containing the debts of the debtors.
- solo_pohladavky_dlznikov: DataFrame containing the solo debts of the debtors (if applicable).
- reference_times: Timestamps indicating the time of reference for the computation.
- db_source_connector: Database connector for the source database.
- db_target_connector: Database connector for the target database.
- deriver: An instance of the Deriver class used for deriving specific values from the debts
